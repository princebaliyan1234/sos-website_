Forced to fight for survival, she crosses every boundary she once swore she'd never break—battling not only the horrors outside but also the ghosts of her past.\n\nAs she struggles to protect her loved ones, she finds herself drawn back to Liam, the boy who once abandoned her, but now may be her only chance at survival. In a world where love and war demand impossible sacrifices, Ava must decide how far she's willing to go—not just to save others, but to fight for her own heart."
